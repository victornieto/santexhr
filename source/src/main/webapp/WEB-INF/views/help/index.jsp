	<p>Candidates enter the system through one of three ways:</p>

	<div class="group">
		<h2>Manually</h2>
		<p>By clicking on <a href="">new candidate</a> you will enter the candidate's information and provide them with an exam link.  The link will give the candidate access to the quiz portal where they will demonstrate their true skills.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="group">
		<h2>Public Exam Links</h2>
		<p>These exam links can be posted with your job listings, allowing anyone to come along and take your exam.  Based on their scores you can decide how best to proceed.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="group">
		<h2>Facilitator</h2>
		<p>It's like magic. The facilitator screens candidate emails looking for useful information and enters them into the system.  Then you can decide what exams are most appropriate for that candidate.</p>
	</div>

	<p>With candidates in the system you will monitor their progress on the candidates's page. Their status will indicate the most recent exam they have taken, and let you follow up.</p>
